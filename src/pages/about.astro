    <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>
    <p>I am <span class="verbColor">working</span> through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the <span class="verbColor">second</span> page on my website, and it's the <span class="verbColor">first</span> one I <span class="verbColor">built</span> myself!</p>
    <p>This site will <span class="verbColor">update</span> as I <span class="verbColor">complete</span> more of the tutorial, so keep <span class="verbColor">checking</span> back and see how my journey is <span class="verbColor">going</span>!</p>

    <ul>
        <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
        <li>I <span class="verbColor">live</span> in {identity.country} and I <span class="verbColor">work</span> as a {identity.occupation}.</li>
        {identity.hobbies.length >= 2 &&
            <li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
        }
    </ul>
    <p>My skills are:</p>
